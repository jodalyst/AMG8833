# AMG8833

Originally inspired by code (and nice breakout module developed <a href="https://github.com/kriswiner/AMG8833" target="_blank">here</a>).  This is a simple i2c library to get images from the module, intended for experimentation purposes.

I can't find an official register map of this device (why would they make this hard get???). Relevant links below:
